# Websites
Some of the stuff I've been working on recently:


# News Website
Here's a link to a News Website I built using PHP, html, a little bit of css, and mySQL where users can share links to stories or articles they find interesting (like Reddit):

I'm primarily interested in backend web development more so than front end. Hence, my website has some good functionality such as supporting users, accounts, profile pages, databases (with foreign keys), comments, rankings, and more. Passwords in my database are hashed and salted, so they are safe. I made sure to use safe sql query practices as well to prevent sql injection attacks.

If you have any questions or inquiries, please contact me at ambalam.v@wustl.edu

Thanks for visiting!
