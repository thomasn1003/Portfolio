Stuff we gotta do:

- create login button somewhere on the homepage
- registered users can make comments
- Unregistered users can only view stories and comments.


- All data must be kept in a MySQL database (user information, stories, comments, and links).
- Make sure everything is secure



creative:
Few ideas off the top of my head:

1. Let users specify a category for their posts (e.g. News, Sports, Pop Culture, etc) and allow filtering of stories by category.
2. Implement a "profile page" where each user's posts are listed.
3. Allow users to change their passwords (though this is pretty simple and would not get full credit on its own).
4. Users can delete their accounts (again, pretty simple and would need another feature implemented).
5. Allow users to 'save' stories and access a list of all their saved stories.

Pick a couple of those or something similar and you should be set to get full credit.
